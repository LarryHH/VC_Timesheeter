## üí° Introduction

The V&C Timesheeter allows for template-based, automated creation of Excel timesheets. The manual creation or duplication of timesheets for the correct payroll period can be a labourous task. Further, future timesheets may need to be duplicated, edited or adjusted for various reasons, which compounds this labour by many magnitudes. The V&C Timehsheeter saves the user time and effort by automating this process:
- Now, timesheets are created with the correct payroll dates for the whole year all at once.
- Any updates to timesheets (e.g. roster changes) only need to be applied once, rather than for every subsequent timesheet.

Simply supply a blank timesheet timeplate with the required updates and V&C Timesheeter will produce a full set of updated timesheets for the given period.

## üìî Detailed Usage Instructions: Read them here! ‚Üí Documentation

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. Prepare a `blank.xlsx` timesheet Excel file. This file should include a `Date` sheet with the timesheet period's `starting date`, where subsequent sheets will rely on this cell to create their date ranges.
2. Make sure the provided or compiled `timesheeter.exe` program and your `blank.xlsx` file are in the same directory.
3. Open `timesheeter.exe`, drag and drop `blank.xlsx` into the specified area.
4. Edit the form fields as necessary (see Instructions for more info).
5. Press <i>Go!</i>. Your created timesheets should now be in the specified output path.

### Compiling `timesheeter.exe` (For Developers)

If you do not have a provided copy of the `timesheeter.exe` program, you can either compile your own or [contact the developer](#contact) and request a new copy.
