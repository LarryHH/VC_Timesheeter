## üí° Introduction

The V&C Timesheeter allows for template-based, automated creation of Excel timesheets. The manual creation or duplication of timesheets for the correct payroll period can be a labourous task. Further, future timesheets may need to be duplicated, edited or adjusted for various reasons, which compounds this labour by many magnitudes. The V&C Timehsheeter saves the user time and effort by automating this process:
- Now, timesheets are created with the correct payroll dates for the whole year all at once.
- Any updates to timesheets (e.g. roster changes) only need to be applied once, rather than for every subsequent timesheet.

Simply supply a blank timesheet timeplate with the required updates and V&C Timesheeter will produce a full set of updated timesheets for the given period.

## üìî Detailed Usage [Instructions](https://github.com/LarryHH/VC_Timesheeter/blob/master/docs/instructions.md) ‚Üê Read them here!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. Prepare a `blank.xlsx` timesheet Excel file (a sample file is provided ['here'](https://github.com/LarryHH/VC_Timesheeter/raw/master/data/blank.xlsx)). This file should include a `Date` sheet with the timesheet period's `starting date`, where subsequent sheets will rely on this cell to create their date ranges.
2. Download the [`VC_Timesheeter.exe`](https://github.com/LarryHH/VC_Timesheeter/releases/) program from the latest release.
3. Make sure the provided or compiled `VC_Timesheeter.exe` program and your `blank.xlsx` file are in the same directory.
4. Open `VC_Timesheeter.exe`, drag and drop `blank.xlsx` into the specified area.
5. Edit the form fields as necessary (see Instructions for more info).
6. Press <i>Go!</i>. Your created timesheets should now be in the specified output path.

### Compiling `VC_Timesheeter.exe` (For Developers)

If you do not have a provided copy of the `VC_Timesheeter.exe` program, you can either compile your own or contact the developer and request a new copy.
1. Clone this repo and do `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `pyinstaller vc.spec` to create the program and libraries. `VC_Timesheeter.exe` will be found inside the created `VC_Timesheeter` folder.
